          <p>You can reach me by email at gaughan [at] u [dot] northwestern [dot] edu </p>
          <p>I am a first-year PhD student in Northwestern University's <a href="https://tsb.northwestern.edu/">Technology and Social Behavior program</a>.</p>
          <p>I am in the process of figuring out the specifics of my research interests, which broadly include free and open source software, collaborative software engineering, and platform politics. </p> 
          <p>Before this, I lived in Seattle, where I worked as a software engineer. I love spending my time jogging, reading, and watching movies.</p>

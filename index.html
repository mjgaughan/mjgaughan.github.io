          <p>Hello! I am a third-year PhD candidate in <a href="https://tsb.northwestern.edu/">Technology and Social Behavior</a> at Northwestern University. I am advised by <a href="https://communication.northwestern.edu/faculty/aaron-shaw.html">Aaron Shaw</a> and <a href="https://dgergle.soc.northwestern.edu/"> Darren Gergle </a> as a member of the <a href="https://wiki.communitydata.science/Main_Page">Community Data Science Collective</a> and the <a href="https://collablab.northwestern.edu/">CollabLab</a>.</p>
          

	<p> My research primarily focuses on developer governance and collaboration within free and open source software projects. I am interested in how software engineering practices inform and reflect project decision making, security risks, and contributor voice. So far, I have primarily used quantitative and computational methods in my research; specifically those in natural language processing. My work draws from research in software engineering, computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW), and organizational sociology. </p>
